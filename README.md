ECMAScript 2015 - used so that functionality runs in most browsers or compile down more recent versions (do not use it)

Lexical this - not what is expected like java

Let vs var - var does not work with block scopes but let does (always use let)

npmjs.com is a good source

writing a note taking app
    npm install -g @angular/cli
        keeps bundle size small
        auto generates components
    ng new noteTakingApp
